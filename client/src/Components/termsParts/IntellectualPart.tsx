        Udemy is a technology platform that enables anyone anywhere to create
        and share educational content. We host hundreds and thousands of courses
        on our online learning marketplace. Our marketplace model means we don’t
        review or edit the content for legal issues, and we aren’t in a position
        to determine the legality of the content. However, Udemy respects the
        intellectual property rights of others and expects instructors on Udemy
        to do the same. When instructors post content on Udemy, they make the
        promise that they have the necessary authorization or rights to use that
        content.
      </p>
      <p>Infringing activity is not tolerated on or through our platform.</p>
      <p>
        This policy addresses what we do in the event of copyright takedown
        notices from content owners and trademark takedown notices from
        trademark owners with respect to the content on the Udemy platform. The
        policy also addresses what we do when Udemy instructors’ courses are
        copied on third-party platforms without their consent.

        Copyright Takedown Notices
      </h2>
      <p>
        Udemy’s policy is to remove content from our service when it is reported
        as infringing in a copyright takedown notice received from the owner of
        the original content. It’s also our policy to remove all content from
        any instructor who’s determined to be a repeat infringer (for whom Udemy
        has received more than two valid copyright takedown notices). We reserve
        the right to terminate an instructor’s account at any time, including
        when they post content in violation of the copyrights of others.

        How to File a Copyright Takedown Notice
      </h2>
      <p>
        If you’d like to report content on the Udemy platform and if you are the
        owner or the designated agent of the owner of the rights to the content
        that you believe the content is infringing, the most efficient way is to
        use this copyright complaint form (form in English only). You may also
        submit notices of alleged copyright infringement to our designated
        copyright agent, identified below. Before you submit a copyright
        takedown notice, please remember these important things:
